Beginning Joomla! by Dan Rahmel, 2nd edition
--------------------------------------------

All of the HTML, PHP, CSS, and image files from the Beginning Joomla! book are located in these folders. These files should provide an excellent foundation for custom templates and extensions.

Any revisions or updates to the code can be found on the APress web site or at Joomla Jumpstart (http://www.joomlajumpstart.com). 

I hope you’ve enjoyed the Joomla book and have learned quite a bit about the most promising CMS available. Joomla can be used to create web sites for everything from hobbyist information to complete e-commerce solutions. 

Please join the Joomla community and make a contribution of information, money to the development team via the nonprofit Open Source Matters (see www.joomla.org and www.opensourcematters.org for more information), new templates, new extensions, or simply goodwill. 
The Joomla community is made up of tens of thousands of enthusiast users. 

I hope you will join us and become another proud Joomla supporter. See you online!
